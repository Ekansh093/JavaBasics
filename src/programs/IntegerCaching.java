         * In Java 5, a new feature was introduced to save the memory and improve performance for Integer
         * type objects handling. Integer objects are cached internally and reused via the same referenced objects.
         *
         * This is applicable for Integer values in the range between â€“128 to +127.
         * This Integer caching works only on auto-boxing. Integer objects will not be cached when they are built
         * using the constructor.
